## Code Evidence

### Option 2: Invest
**File**: `server.js`, Line 356
```javascript
const successMessage = `Investment of KES ${toK(amount)} into ${user.fund} successful...`;
return successMessage + welcomeMenu();  // ← Returns to menu!
```

### Option 3: Withdraw  
**File**: `server.js`, Line 424

```

### Option 4: Check Balance

const balanceMessage = `Current Balance: KES ${toK(bal)}\n\n`;
return balanceMessage + welcomeMenu();  // ← Returns to menu!

### Option 5: Track Account
**File**: `server.js`, Line 483
```javascript
const lines = [

## Real-World Flow Example

```
User: Dial *710*56789#
Server: Shows welcome menu ✅

User: Press 2 (Invest)
Server: Asks for amount ✅

User: Enter 5000
Server: Asks for PIN ✅

User: Enter 1234
Server: ✅ Investment successful
        Sends SMS notification
        Shows result + returns to menu ✅

User: Can now press 3 (Withdraw) or 4 (Balance) or exit
Server: Session continues ✅
```

## How It Works

The key is in the response prefixes:

- **`CON`** = Continue session (keep USSD active)
- **`END`** = End session (terminates USSD)

All successful transactions return:
```javascript
return successMessage + welcomeMenu();
```

This creates a response like:
```
CON Investment successful. New balance: 5,000

Welcome to Gkash, Learn.Invest.Grow
1. Create account
2. Invest
3. Withdraw
4. Check balance
5. Track account
```

The USSD session stays open, allowing users to perform multiple transactions!

## Conclusion

✅ **All 5 menu options provide complete end-to-end functionality**
✅ **After each transaction, the user returns to the main menu**
✅ **Sessions continue until the user explicitly hangs up**
✅ **Users can chain multiple transactions in one session**
